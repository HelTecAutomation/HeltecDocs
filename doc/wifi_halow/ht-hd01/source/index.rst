**This document is still under construction and will be completed soon.**

Summry
------
HT-HD01 is a plug-and-play network bridge that can greatly extend the transmission range of traditional Wi-Fi and Ethernet, with lower power consumption and greater penetration. You can think of it as a 1-2 km invisible network cable, and it can still maintain a high transmission speed at a limit distance.
