HT-HD01 Mesh Mode User Guide
============================

:ht_translation:`[简体中文]:[Eglish]`

Introduction
------------
The HD01 supports Mesh networking mode, and you can even use it to achieve relay functionality. However, please note the following three points:

- In this mode, one node must act as the MeshGate to connect to the upstream network, while the other nodes serve as MeshPoints.
- In this mode, only devices with the same MeshID can communicate with each other.
- The transmission rate decreases by 50% with each relay.
