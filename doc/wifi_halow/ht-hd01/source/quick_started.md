# HaLow Dongle Quick Starded

{ht_translation}`[简体中文]:[English]`

We have provided a plug-and-play mode for the HT-HD01 to help you get started more quickly. The devices are pre-paired at the factory, and you can use them directly without any configuration.

## Start Access Point
Connect the Dongle-AP to the upstream router and power it on.

There are two ways to connect to the upstream router, you can choose any one of them:

- Via Ethernet cable: just plug in the cable directly.
- Via 2.4G Wi-Fi: refer to ["Dongle AP Setting"](https://docs.heltec.org/en/wifi_halow/ht-hd01/ap.html#access-via-wifi-2.4g).

When the device's red light changes to blue or green and stays on, it indicates that the device is functioning properly.

``` {warning} The blue light of the device represents a USB-C cable, and the green light represents an RJ45 cable. If the color of your indicator does not match the type of network cable you are connected to, you need to change the color of the indicator by pressing the button.
```

## Start Station
Power on the Dongle-STA. When the device's red light changes to blue or green and stays on, it indicates that the device is functioning properly.
