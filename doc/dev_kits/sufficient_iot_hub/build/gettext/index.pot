msgid "Sufficient IoT Hub is a Linux system-in-package with a dual-core 64-bit ARM A7 processor running at 1GHz and 128MB of DDR3. This is a device designed exclusively for IoT scenarios, with LoRa, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth built in. We also build a dedicated Sufficient IoT OS for it, so even if the user has no programing background, they can easily operate PWM, I2C, SPI, LoRa, etc. to develop whatever they want."
