Sufficient IoT Hub is a Linux system-in-package with a dual-core 64-bit ARM A7 processor running at 1GHz and 128MB of DDR3. This is a device designed exclusively for IoT scenarios, with LoRa, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth built in. We also build a dedicated Sufficient IoT OS for it, so even if the user has no programing background, they can easily operate PWM, I2C, SPI, LoRa, etc. to develop whatever they want.

For example: It can be used to read sensors data from I2C and transmit via LoRaWAN. or as a MQTT broker, or as a LoRa Server in a local area network, or even as a LoRa gateway via an expansion panel.

**Sufficient IoT Hub have following main features:**

- Dual-Core ARM CortexTM-A7 CPU;
- SiP 128MB DDR3 RAM;
- SD 3.0 slot;
- Operation system is based on Linux 5.4 Kernel, Debian;
- Multi-interface (I2C, SPI, Ethernet, ADC, PWM, USB Host);
- Built-in XR829 Wi-Fi & Bluetooth chip;
- Built-in SX1262 LoRa node chip.
