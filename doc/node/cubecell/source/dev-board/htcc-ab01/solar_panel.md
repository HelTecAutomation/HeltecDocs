{ht_translation}`[简体中文]:[English]`

Please refer to the [pinout diagram of HTCC-AB01](https://resource.heltec.cn/download/CubeCell/HTCC-AB01/HTCC-AB01_PinoutDiagram.pdf).

The `VS` pin is the solar panel input, any 5.5~7V solar panel can be connected to this `VS` and `GND`.

``` {Note} Solar panels can&#39;t be a power source for the whole system, so it must work with a chargeable Li-Po battery. The CubeCell HTCC-AB01 Dev-Board already integrated a battery and solar panel manage system on-board.
