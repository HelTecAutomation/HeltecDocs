## First Charge
The Meshtower comes pre-configured with battery management settings. It is ready to use once you connect the solar panel and antenna.<br>
However, before first use, it is recommended to activate the battery function and fully charge the battery via the USB-C port or DC interface.
### Via USB-C(recommended)
The USB-C port requires PS3.0 and a 20V voltage input.
