In the capsule sensor, it's already integrates a charge management circuit, but does not have an over-discharge protection circuit, so **the lithium battery must have a protection circute**. Battery must include following features:

- Voltage: 3.7V
- Charging voltage: 4.2V
- Discharge cut-off voltage: ≤3.3V
