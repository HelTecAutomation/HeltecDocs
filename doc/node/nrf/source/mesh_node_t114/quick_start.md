# Mesh Node Series Quick Start
{ht_translation}`[简体中文]:[English]`

This topic describes how to install the development environments and libraries for the Mesh Node family and how to use the sample code.
## Install Framework

**there are three methods to install the framework, choose one of them.**`

- [Via Arduino board manager](use-arduino-board-manager)
- [Via Git](via-git)
- [Via Local File](via-local-file)

### Via Arduino board manager

This section describes "How to install the Heltec-nRF52 development framework directly from the Arduino board manager".

1. Install Arduino IDE, you can refer to this link: [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://docs.heltec.org/general/how_to_install_git_and_arduino.html).
2. Open Arduino IDE, and click `File`->`Peferences`->`Settings`

3. Input following json url to board manager URLs:

```
https://resource.heltec.cn/download/package_heltec_nrf_index.json

```

4. Click`OK` to return to the main Arduino interface.
4. Click `Boards Manager...`, search `Heltec-nRF52` in the new pop-up dialog, select the latest `releases` and  click `install`.

``` {Tip} If you disconnect before the installation is complete, don't panic. Click **Install** to continue the download.
```

6. Click `tools` to confirm whether the development environment is installed successfully.

### Via Local File

1. Download the development environment. []()

2. Open Arduino IDE, and click `File`->`Peferences`.

4. Create a new "**hardware**" folder in the Arduino folder. If there is already a "hardware" folder, you don't need to create a new one.

4. Go to the "hardware" folder and extract "heltec" into this folder.

```{Tip} This folder name is custom. If you have installed other heltec framework, you can use this folder directly.
```

5. Go to the "heltec" folder, refer to the figure below to confirm whether the path in the red box is correct. Unzip the compressed package you downloaded to this path.

## Running an Example

Connect your Mesh Node series board to computer via a **high quality** Micro USB cable *(This is the most common reason we had encountered can't program software)*. 

1. Open the `tools` option and select the corresponding device and port.

## New a sketch

1. In Arduino IDE, click `File --> new` .

2. Copy the following code:

```arduino
  // the setup routine runs once when starts up
  void setup(){

    // Initialize the Heltec ASR650x object


  // the loop routine runs over and over again forever
  void loop() {

  }
```
