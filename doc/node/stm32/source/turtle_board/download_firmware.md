  - If the board is not connected to the computer —— press the "USER" button of the Lora node before inserting it into any USB port of the computer (press the “USER"  key all the time before inserting, and release it after connecting to the USB port).
  - If the board had connected to the computer —— Keep the “USER” button pressed → Press the "RST" button → Release the "RST" button → Release the "USER" button.

  ```{Warning} For Turtle Board, if you use "STM32CubeProgrammer" to download firmware, it may damage the bootloader of the Turtle Board, so we recommend using "RadioShuttle STM32 Utility".
  
  ```

  ***The advantage of using the DFU mode is that you can easily find a Micro USB cable. But the disadvantage is that there is no way to simulate online.***
