Wireless Stick
================
:ht_translation:`[简体中文]:[English]`

Wireless Stick is a development board for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and LoRa. Its functions are
basically the same as "WiFi Lora 32", except that the screen is reduced to 0.49 inch and
a shielding shell is added.

The Wireless Stick is composed up of an MCU (ESP32-S3FN8) and Semtech LoRa Transceivers
(SX1262), perfectly support Arduino. Users can easily carry out secondary
development and application.
