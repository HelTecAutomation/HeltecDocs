## Connecting to the server

Before that, make sure your lora gateway is registered with the relevant server and is working well.

We highly recommend the following three gateways:

[HT-M02](https://heltec.org/project/ht-m02-v2/)  [HT-M01S](https://heltec.org/project/ht-m01s-v2/)  [HT-M7603](https://heltec.org/project/ht-m7603/)

### Manual registration

When you are done in the configuration page, you can register the node with TTN/TTS, Chirpstack, SnapEmu, and other LoRaWAN servers by following this link: [Connect “ESP32 + LoRa” to LoRaWAN Server ](https://docs.heltec.org/en/node/esp32/lorawan/connect_to_gateway.html)

### One-click scan registration
```{Note} Only devices with the LoRaWAN program already installed at the factory can use the one-click code scanning registration function. If you refresh your firmware, or modify device parameters, please use manual registration.
```

1. Install SnapEmu App. 

2. Open SnapEmu, click the `+` in the upper right corner, select `SCAN`.
