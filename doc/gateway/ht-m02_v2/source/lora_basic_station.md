# LoRa Basics™ Station
The LoRa Basics™ Station protocol simplifies management of large scale LoRaWAN® networks. LoRa Basics™ Station is the preferred way of connecting Gateways to The Things Stack.
## Upgrade firmware

*If your device already have the **Basic Station** in **Protocol** on the configuration page, skip this 'Upgrade' step.*

If your HT-M02 does not have the 'Basic Station' feature upgraded, you can do so over SSH.

1. Make sure your device is working and connected to the network.

   *Reference linking: [HT-M02 Quick Start](https://docs.heltec.org/en/gateway/ht-m02_v2/quick_start.html).*

2. Use SSH to connect to the device. The default port is `22`, the login name is **root**, and the password is **heltec.org**.
   
   *Reference linking: [SSH](https://docs.heltec.org/en/gateway/ht-m02_v2/quick_start.html#ssh).*

3. Run the following command

```sh
    rm -rf update_* && wget http://minerback.heltec.cn/download/update_basicstation.sh && chmod +x update_basicstation.sh && ./update_basicstation.sh
```

4. After the installation is completed, refresh the device configuration page, and you can see that the Basic Station function is available.
