# HT-M02_V2 Edge LoRa Gateway  Quick Start
{ht_translation}`[简体中文]:[English]`
## Summary

HT-M02_V2 has integrated operating system and LoRa related programs, so it can be used directly in applications.  HT-M02_V2  has multiple optional versions, the main difference is the networking mode and power supply mode. The power supply mode is divided into POE mode and 12V DC mode. Different network modes have different gateway configuration methods. Please refer to the corresponding version for specific configuration methods.

- [ETH Version](eth-version)
- [ETH & WIFI Version](eth&wifi-version)
- [ETH & 4G Version](eth&4g-version)
- [ETH & WIFI & 4G versions](eth&wifi&4g-version)

```{Tip} Before you use POE for power supply, please confirm whether your gateway supports POE. If not, you can choose to use a [POE splitter](https://heltec.org/product/miner-poe-splitter).

```



## Basic Gateway Configuration

(eth-version)=

### ETH Version

Connect the antenna and network cable to the gateway, and then connect the gateway power supply. Check the ETH MAC address of the gateway on the gateway label, find it in the router, and log in to the configuration page through its IP address.

## Establish Serial/SSH Connection

If required, HT-M02_V2 can provide serial/SSH connection.

Default login user name: root

Default login password: heltec.org

### Serial

Because of the waterproof design, the UART interface is not directly exposed outside. If need a serial port connection, need to remove the protective board on the side of the HT-M02_V2, and also a UART-USB bridge is required (CP2102, CP2104, CH340G etc.).

- HT-M02_V2 TXD `<---->` UART-USB bridge RXD
- HT-M02_V2 RXD `<---->` UART-USB bridge TXD
- HT-M02_V2 GND `<---->` UART-USB bridge GND

Select an appropriate serial port debugging tool. Recommended to use [Putty](https://putty.org/). Select the port corresponding to the UART-USB bridge. The default baud rate is 115200. You can refer to the following configuration.

### SSH

Establish SSH connection need make sure the client in a same LAN with HT-M02_V2, SSH use default Port 22.
