# Connect HT-M02_V2 to a LoRa Server
{ht_translation}`[简体中文]:[English]`

## Summary

This article aims to describe how to connect [HT-M02_V2 Gateway](https://heltec.org/project/ht-m02-v2/) to a LoRa server, such as [TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), [ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/), which facilitates secondary development and rapid deployment of LoRa devices.

Before all operation, make sure the HT-M02 is runing well . If not, please refer to this [HT-M02_V2 Quick Start](https://docs.heltec.org/en/gateway/ht-m02_v2/quick_start.html) document.

## Connect to TTN/TTS

### Configure Gateway

Configure your gateway and fill in the server address as the server you want to connect to, please refer to the [HT-M2802 Quick Start](https://docs.heltec.org/en/gateway/ht-m2802/quick_start.html) document.

### Register a LoRa gateway in TTN/TTS

*Select a cluster in the [TTN console](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/) page to start adding devices and gateways. Or start adding devices and gateways in [TTS console](https://lora.heltec.org/console).*

- **Gateway EUI** -- The unique ID of HT-M02 gateway, view from the display screen of the HT-M02 or view through the serial port (the gateway ID will be printed through the serial port when the HT-M02 starts).
- **Gateway ID** -- Generated by default.
- **Gateway name** -- Filled in by the user, can be filled in arbitrarily.
- **Frequency Plan** -- Matches the LoRa band configuration in HT-M01S.

*View gateway status, it is runing:*

## Connect to ChirpStack server

[ChirpStack](https://www.chirpstack.io/) is the most popular LoRa server open source project, widely used in many fields, and also the best choise for a private LoRa server.

### ChirpStack Gateway Bridge

**One thing need attention!** the ChirpStack need a special service named `Gateway Bridge`, which converts LoRa® Packet Forwarder protocols into a ChirpStack Network Server common data-format(JSON and Protobuf).

the `Gateway Bridge` service can running on the Raspberry Pi or the ChirpStack server.

Install ChirpStack Gateway Bridge: [https://www.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/install/debian/](https://www.chirpstack.io/gateway-bridge/install/debian/)

### Register LoRa Gateway in ChirpStack

*Fill in the HT-M02 information as shown below and complete the addition.*

   - `Name` and `Description` can be filled in freely, and they will become the name and remark of the device displayed on the platform. 
   - `Group` denotes the grouping of the device on SnapEmu.
   - `Device type` This device is a gateway, so choose "LoRaGate".
   - `Region` Match the frequency band of the gateway.
   - `GatewayEUI` Gateway ID, through device configuration page or scan the device QR code to obtain.



*After filling in the information, click Submit and refresh the page to see the device.*
