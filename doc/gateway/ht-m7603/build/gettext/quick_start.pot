msgid "HT-M7603 is positioned as a low-cost standard gateway for indoor use. LoRa part based on the SX1303 + 1250 structure,  we innovatively use ESP32 as the main control chip, and completely transplant the hardware driver, data forwarding and message queue of SX1303 to the ESP32 platform. There is no need to run the Linux operating system separately. With simple configuration, it allows you to bridge  to IP networks and different network servers via Wi-Fi or Ethernet."
