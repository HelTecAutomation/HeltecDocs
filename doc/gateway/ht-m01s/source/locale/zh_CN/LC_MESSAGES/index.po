"HT-M01S is positioned as a low-cost standard gateway for indoor use. LoRa"
" part based on the SX1308 + 1255/7 structure,  we innovatively use ESP32 "
"as the main control chip, and completely transplant the hardware driver, "
"data forwarding and message queue of SX1308 to the ESP32 platform. There "
"is no need to run the Linux operating system separately. It is simpler "
"and more convenient to use. HT-M01S has basic mechanical protection and "
"dustproof structure, but does not have waterproof performance. It can be "
"connected to the cloud server via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, can be powered by "
"Type-C_5V or PoE, and has a 1.8-inch TFT display under the tempered glass"
" panel. It is very suitable for deployment in factories, warehouses, "
"homes and other indoor environments that can provide power and network."
