msgid "This article aims to describe how to connect nodes to [HT-M00 Gateway](https://heltec.org/project/ht-m00/), which facilitates secondary development and rapid deployment of LoRa devices. HT-M00 is a dual-channel gateway. To ensure good communication between the node and the gateway, the channel used by the node must correspond to that of the HT-M00 gateway. This document takes CN470 as an example."

Converting hexadecimal FF to binary is 11111111. The 11111111 from low bits to high bits correspond to the first 0-7 channels, that is, the last 1 corresponds to channel 0, and the first 1 corresponds to channel 7.
