msgid "HT-M00 is a small, low-cost dual-channel LoRa gateway, Use Type-C interface. The HT-M00 gateway drives two SX1276 chips based on ESP32. We have written a software mixer (baseband simulation program) to monitor the spreading factor of 125KHz SF7~SF12. The main function of HT-M00 is to provide LoRaWAN network for large houses of 1500~2000 square meters, or to make up for the blind spots of the signal in the area that the SX1301 gateway signal cannot cover."

msgid "When using the HT-M00 gateway, you need to change the node's preamble length to 16 (default is 8). If the preamble length is 8, the minimum SF and the maximum SF need to be set equal, otherwise only the minimum SF will be received. For example, the length of the node's preamble length is 8, and the gateway sets the minimum SF to 7 and the maximum SF to 12, then only SF7 will be received."
