"HT-M01S (Rev. 2.0) is positioned as a low-cost standard gateway for "
"indoor use. LoRa part based on the SX1303 + 1250 structure,  we "
"innovatively use ESP32 as the main control chip, and completely "
"transplant the hardware driver, data forwarding and message queue of "
"SX1303 to the ESP32 platform. There is no need to run the Linux operating"
" system separately. It is simpler and more convenient to use. It can be "
"connected to the cloud server via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, can be powered by "
"Type-C_5V, and has a 1.8-inch TFT display under the tempered glass panel "
"to display gateway information."
