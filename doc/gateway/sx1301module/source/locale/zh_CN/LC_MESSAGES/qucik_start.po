"For SX1301 and SX1308, their performance, drivers, interface packaging, "
"and functions are completely the same. The difference is the operating "
"temperature range. SX1301 is positioned as an outdoor type, and SX1308 is"
" positioned as an indoor type. Cooperate with suitable driver hardware "
"and Linux operating system (such as Raspberry Pi), then it can work as a "
"LoRa gateway."
