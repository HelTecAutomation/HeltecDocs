4. When the configuration is completed, click `Submit` and press the `RST` key. The white LED is always on, indicating that the device enters the working mode.

## Data format
The following figure shows the data format of communication between HRI-4852 and HRI-4851:

![](img/08.png)

When the node sends *aa bb*, the server receives *HRI-4852 address + HRI-4851 address +aa bb*;

Similarly, if the server needs to issue *aa bb* instructions to the node, it needs to add the corresponding *HRI-4852 address + HRI-4851 address+ aa bb*.
