``` {Note} 'BaudRate' 'Data Mode' should be consistent with the terminal device.
```

``` {Tip} When the Address is *FFFF*, the device communicates with a device of any address(Group still has to be the same)
```

3. By clicking the `Enable periodic query` option, you can set up to 10 polling commands, and when multiple commands are run at the same time, they will be executed automatically at five-second intervals.

4. Click `Submit` when the configuration is complete. 

**If you need to upload HRI-4851 data to the server, you need to use with HRI-4852: [HRI-4852 User Manual](docs.heltec.org/en/ready_to_use/hri-485x/hri-4852.html)**

## Data Format
As shown above, HRI-4851 with the same parameters can communicate with each other, that is, A terminal sends *0xaa 0xbb*, and B terminal receives *0xaa 0xbb*.

**When you are familiar with the basic functions of HRI-4851 and HRI-4852, you can use the following two functions of HRI-4851 to make more networking methods**

## HRI-4851 Relayer

The HRI-4851 can realize the relay function, and the two terminals of its connection can be either the HRI-4851 or the HRI-4852.

Enter the configuration page of HRI-4851, select `Relay `in the `Mode` option, and then configure its lora parameters and `Group` to be the same as the two terminals.

## HRI-4851 Gateway

When HRI-4851 is in gateway mode, it can communicate with all HRI-4851 in the same Group.

This feature does not connect to a server, but is available directly in the terminal.

Enter the configuration page of HRI-4851, select `Gateway `in the `Mode` option, and then configure its lora parameters and `Group` to be the same as the two terminals.
