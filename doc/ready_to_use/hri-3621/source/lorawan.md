# Connect to LoRaWAN Server

{ht_translation}`[简体中文]:[English]`

This topic describes how to connect the Sensor Hub for Industry to the LoRaWAN server.
## Retrieve Device Information
You need to access the device's configuration page to retrieve relevant information.<br>

*If you are unsure how to access this page, please refer to this link: https://docs.heltec.org/en/ready_to_use/hri-3621/quick_start.html#configuration*

----------------------------------------------

## LoRa Gateway
Before starting, ensure that:
- Your LoRaWAN gateway is already activated on the server.<br>
- The **REGION (Band)** of the gateway and node must be the same, and the gateway's **Channel** must include the node's **Channel**.

*If you are unsure how to choose a gateway, you can visit the [Heltec official website](https://heltec.org/product-category/lora/lora-gateway/) to select one.*

``` {Tip} joinEUI corresponds to AppEUI on the device.
```

``` {Tip} Heltec's products use LoRaWAN1.0.2 revision B.
```

5. Click `General Setting` to check whether the configuration is correct, drop down to the `Network layer` option, click `Expand`, and continue to check.

``` {Tip} The General Setting option is On the upper right corner. Be careful not to choose the wrong one. The General Setting option on the left is used to change the parameters of the Application.
```

``` {Tip} The default is Class_A after registration, and if the node is Class_C or Class_B, it needs to be selected and saved here.
```

## Important Hints

Please double check the following two things:

1. The LoRaWAN parameters is the same as server!
2. The listening frequency of your LoRa Gateway is the same as ESP32 LoRa node's sending frequency. We strictly follow [LoRaWAN™ 1.0.2 Regional Parameters rB](https://resource.heltec.cn/download/LoRaWANRegionalParametersv1.0.2_final_1944_1.pdf);
