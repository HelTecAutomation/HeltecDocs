HRU-3622 is a sub-model of the Sensor Hub for outdoor series that specifically drives third-party sensors. Its interface is a flange seat, with 2 RS485 interfaces and 4 GPIO interfacesIt can be used to drive a variety of third-party sensors.
Sensor Hub for Industry has excellent low power consumption and long transmission distance characteristics, comes with a built-in 1100mAh rechargeable battery. The stainless-steel shell and high-strength plastic provide an IP66 protection level, allowing it to perform stably and excellently in complex industrial environments.

## Power supply
HRI-3622 integrates a 1100aMh rechargeable lithium battery, charging voltage is 5V and its charging interface is magnetic-2P, a single filling time is about 3~4 hours.

## Connect third-party sensors

There are two recommended ways to connect sensors:

### Connect the sensor directly to the HRI-3622.

 + We provide 12mm 8Pin flange conversion head, first through the flange seat diagram below, you can connect the pin of the sensor to the conversion head.

### Connect via Junction box
 + Connect the sensor junction box.

 + Connect the Junction box with the conversion head.

 + Connect the conversion head to the flange seat of the sensor hub and gently screw it on.

## Configura
### Enter Configuration mode
+ Long press the button on the top of the device, and the device will first display white light and then orange light. At this time, release your finger.

``` {Tip} If long press does not respond, try to connect the charging cable to wake up the battery management system. If the blue light/green light blinks sequentially after long press, it means that the device is in working state. After 5 seconds, when the light is all out and no longer blinks, release your finger and long press again to enter the configuration page. 

```

## Operating
### Power off
After the configuration is completed, long press the button for five seconds, and when the light goes off, the device is shut down.
### Power on
Press the button for 3 seconds. When the button shows white light, release the button. At this time, the device enters the working state, where the sending is green light and the receiving is purple light.

## Common problems and solutions
+ Unable to confirm device working status.
  Press the device button once, and if it shows blue light, it will wake up, and the device will upload a message immediately.

+ Device not working:
  After each configuration, you must button off in, then button on.
