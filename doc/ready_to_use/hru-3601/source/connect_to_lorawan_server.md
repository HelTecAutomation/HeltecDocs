# Connect to LoRaWAN Server
This topic describes how to upload the data of HRU-3601 to the LoRa server.
## Register and activate the LoRaWAN gateway
Before that, you have to make sure that you have a LoRaWAN gateway running on the server. If you do not have a LoRaWAN gateway or do not know how to register, you can refer to the Heltec LoRa gateway related instructions, you can choose one of them:

- [HT-M02 Edge LoRa Gateway](https://docs.heltec.org/en/gateway/ht-m02_v2/index.html)
- [HT-M7603 Indoor LoRa Gateway ](https://docs.heltec.org/en/gateway/ht-m7603/index.html)
- [HT-M2802 Indoor LoRa Gateway](https://docs.heltec.cn/en/gateway/ht-m2802/index.html)
- [HT-M01S (Rev. 2.0)](https://docs.heltec.org/en/gateway/ht-m01s_v2/index.html)

## Register and activate HRU-3601
### Get configuration information

## Important Hints

Please double check the following two things:

1. The LoRaWAN parameters is the same as server!
2. The listening frequency of your LoRa Gateway is the same as LoRa node's sending frequency. We strictly follow [LoRaWANâ„¢ 1.0.2 Regional Parameters rB](https://resource.heltec.cn/download/LoRaWANRegionalParametersv1.0.2_final_1944_1.pdf);
