# Connect to LoRaWAN Server

{ht_translation}`[简体中文]:[English]`

This topic describes how to connect Wireless Aggregator to the LoRaWAN server. Before you start, make sure you have the following two things:

- Set up your Wireless Aggregator. Quickstart and entry into configuration mode for the HRI-363X is available here: [Quickstar](https://docs.heltec.org/en/ready_to_use/3631/quick_start.html).

- Make sure your lora gateway is registered with the relevant server and is working well.
We highly recommend the following three gateways:
[HT-M02](https://heltec.org/project/ht-m02-v2/)  [HT-M01s](https://heltec.org/project/ht-m01s-v2/)    [HT-M7603](https://heltec.org/project/ht-m7603/)

``` {Tip} The General Setting option is On the upper right corner. Be careful not to choose the wrong one. The General Setting option on the left is used to change the parameters of the Application.

## Important Hints

Please double check the following two things:

1. The LoRaWAN parameters is the same as server!
2. The listening frequency of your LoRa Gateway is the same as ESP32 LoRa node's sending frequency. We strictly follow [LoRaWAN™ 1.0.2 Regional Parameters rB](https://resource.heltec.cn/download/LoRaWANRegionalParametersv1.0.2_final_1944_1.pdf);
