===========================================
:ht_translation:`[简体中文]:[English]`

`HRI-3632 <https://heltec.org/project/hri-3632/>`_ is a LoRaWAN conveter belonging to Sensor Hub for outdoor series,used to drive various third-party sensors. We have added 4 GPIO to it and equipped it with junction box to ensure the compatibility of its interfaces. Benefits from the IP66 protection provided by high-strength plastics, it can adapt to a variety of complex outdoor environments.

HRI-3632 has the characteristics of low power consumption and long transmission distance. Built-in large capacity rechargeable battery, which can be charged through the DC power and solar interface, ensures that it can work stably for a long time.
**Wireless Aggregator have following main features:**


- Industrial grade protection structure, IP66 protection grade, Lightning protection design, ESD protection and isolation.
- Ultra-low power consumption design.
- With special junction box, interface compatibility isstrong.
- Built-in 1900mAh x4 rechargeable battery, can be charged by DC and solar energy.
- Wireless data transmission communication radius up to 1.5~5km.
- Working condition: -40~80°C, Working humidity: ≤90% (non-condensing).
- Power supply mode: built-in battery or external 5~24V DC powersupply.
