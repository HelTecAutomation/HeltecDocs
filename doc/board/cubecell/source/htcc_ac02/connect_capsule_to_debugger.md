# Connect Capsule to Debugger
{ht_translation}`[简体中文]:[English]`

The capsule sensor itself is positioned as a small-sized, assembled and deployed sensor. It does not have programming, debugging, and other interfaces. You need to use the [Debug Board](https://heltec.org/product/cubecell-capsule-debug/) in order to program and debug the program.

Both the capsule sensor body and the debug board have a round white marking point. When connecting, the position of the white points should be matched.

After the connection is completed, the sensor body and the debugging board are integrated into one body, and the pins are in a corresponding relationship, which is convenient for plugging in various sensors.
