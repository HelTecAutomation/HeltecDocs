## Can't Download Firmware

- Use a better USB cable, or change a USB socket;
- Check and make sure the CP210x drive had been correctly installed, users can refer to this document: [Establish Serial Connection](https://heltec-automation-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/establish_serial_connection.html);
- Press "PRG" button before upload.

## Orange LED Blink Problem

Annoying orange LED lights are always flashing? It's because the battery management chip MCP73831. with the following control logic:

- Blink -- Power on
- Light -- Charging
- Turn OFF -- Battery filled

Change this capacitor to 220nF to temporarily correct this problem.

We had use the TP4054 to replace MCP73831, the orange LED have new control logic:

- Dim -- Power on
- Light -- Charging
- Turn OFF -- Battery filled

## Another Communication Bus Usage Example

- **[SPI0 / SPI1 / SPI2 / SPI3](https://github.com/Heltec-Aaron-Lee/WiFi_Kit_series/tree/master/esp32/libraries/SPI/examples/SPI_Multiple_Buses)**
- **[I2C0 / I2C1](https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32/blob/master/examples/ESP32/I2C1_Scanner/I2C1_Scanner.ino)**
- **[UART0 / UART1](https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32/blob/master/examples/ESP32/Serial2/Serial2.ino)**

## System Reset All the Time

![](img/frequently_asked_questions/resetallthetime.png)

According to the situation we have collected so far, the most likely to cause a constant reset problem may have two reasons:

- Power supply problem: please make sure the voltage of USB ≥ 4.7V, 300mA;
- You chose an error board: because each type of board may have a different FLASH size, and they have a different partition map, it will cause the internal logic error.

## About WiFi LoRa 32(V2) Sleep Current Test

Use the battery to power the development board, and connect an ammeter to the positive pole of the battery. Download this [Example Code](https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32/blob/master/examples/Low_Power/Low_Power.ino)

This video is the test effect:[Test Video](https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDI2NTE1NTQ3Ng==.html?spm=a2h3j.8428770.3416059.1)

## Node to node communication

On the premise of no hardware problem, LoRa nodes can communicate with each other node-to-node. The key to success node-to-node communication need make sure the following 7 points the same:

1.  The same sending and listening frequency: `LoRa.setFrequency(frequency);`
2.  The same bandwidth: `LoRa.setSignalBandwidth(signalBandwidth);`
3.  The same coding rate: `LoRa.setCodingRate4(codingRateDenominator);`
4.  The same preamble length: `LoRa.setPreambleLength(preambleLength);`
5.  The same sync word: `LoRa.setSyncWord(syncWord);`
6.  The status of `LORA_IQ_INVERSION` is the same;
7.  the same `SPREADING FACTOR`;

Know more information about LoRa node-to-node communication, please refer to LoRa basic library APIs: `https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/Heltec_ESP32/blob/master/src/lora/API.md`

## Vext control

The `Vext` is a power source for external devices. Refer from the schematic diagram, It's controlled by GPIO21:

`GPIO 21 --> LOW --> Vext(3.3V/250mA) ON`

`GPIO 21 --> HIGH --> Vext(3.3V/250mA) OFF`
