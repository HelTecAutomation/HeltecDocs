# LoRaWAN Frequency Plans and Regulations by Country

[简体中文](https://heltec-automation.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/general/lorawan_frequency_plans_by_country.html)

## Summary

This document is only a summary of radio regulations, and the appropriate frequency plan that should be used in the corresponding countries. This is in no way an official document; gateway owners are still obliged to find, study and adhere to their own country’s regulations. Some countries also expect you to register your gateway, or obtain a license. In that case you are using a “free band”, not a “license free band”. In some countries it is also necessary that the gateway is certified (CE, FCC, …) if you allow other people to also communicate via it.
