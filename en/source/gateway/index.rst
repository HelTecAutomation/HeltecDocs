We believe `the CubeCell Series <https://heltec.org/cubecell>`__ is the best
choice for LoRaWAN node applications. The following are some of the key
features:

-  Fully compatible with the Arduino development environment;
-  Based on an ultra low power design, attains 3.5uA in deep sleep mode, even with
   the RTC clock running;
-  Low-cost despite its current state of the art technology;
-  Integrated encryption algorithm protects your investment by rendering cloned firmware inoperative;
-  Based on proven technology - the new ASR650x, is a combination of the PSoC4000 and SX1262 into  a single chip, reducing the overall size to something smaller than the competition;
   
-  Solar panel support;
-  LoRaWAN protocol support;
-  AT command support;
-  In the LoRaWAN relevant examples, have a reasonable timeline
   planning.

.. tip::

   for example, an application need send data to server every 10 minutes, then in a cycle, only ~1 second is in the state of sending, other 9 minutes and 59 seconds are in deep sleep low power Consuming status.
