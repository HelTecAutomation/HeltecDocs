==============================
`简体中文 <https://heltec-automation.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/gateway/ht-m01/index.html>`_

HT-M01 is a Pico cell gateway. When we designing it, we wanted to provide users with an SX1308 gateway that can quickly verify communication solutions and support the standard LoRaWAN protocol. HT-M01 has a small size, can operating by Windows® or Linux. Windows® will have a GUI tool, which is friendly for none Linux experience users.

-  SX1308 baseband chip;
-  LoRaWAN protocol 1.0.2 Class A, Class C support;
-  SPI and USB support, can working in Windows® and Linux;
-  Heat dissipation design, transfers the huge heat of the SX1308 to the aluminum casing to ensure the stability of the system.

.. note::

   HT-M01 can't work alone, it must work with other operating systems, such as a Raspberry Pi with Linux, or a Windows® computer (Windows® 7 or higher).
