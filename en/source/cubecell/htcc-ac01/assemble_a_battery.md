# Assemble a battery to Capsule sensor

The capsule sensor is a global product, but because of international transportation, storage and other problems, **default is no integrated battery inside the Capsule sensor**.

&nbsp;

After disassembling the sensor shell, you can see 2 pads on the round PCB at the bottom, and solder the battery positive and negative electrodes to this pad:

## Battery specifications

In the capsule sensor, it's already integrates a charge management circuit (see [Capsule sensor bottom plate schematic diagram]()), but does not have an over-discharge protection circuit, so **the lithium battery must have a protection circute**. Battery mush include following features:

- Voltage: 3.7V
- Charging voltage: 4.2V
- Discharge cut-off voltage: ≤3.3V
